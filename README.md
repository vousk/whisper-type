## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.12+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (tested on RTX 4060)
- Up-to-date NVIDIA driver

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/TryoTrix/whisper-type.git
cd whisper-type
install.bat
```

The installer will:
1. Check for Python, pip, and NVIDIA GPU
2. Create a project-local virtual environment in `.venv`
3. Install all Python packages into `.venv`
4. Ask whether you want autostart at Windows login
   If enabled, create an autostart entry using `.venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe`
   If disabled, you can launch manually via `whisper-dictate.bat`
5. Download the Whisper model (~3 GB, one-time)
6. Start the dictation tool

## Uninstall

Run:

```
uninstall.bat
```

The uninstaller will:
1. Remove the autostart Registry Run key (if it exists)
2. Clean Startup leftovers (`Whisper Diktiertool.lnk` and StartupApproved ghost entry)
3. Ask whether to keep local logs/config/history
   If kept, files are left as-is
   If not kept, logs are emptied and `whisper-config.json` is removed
4. Ask whether to keep downloaded Whisper model cache
   If not kept, Whisper model folders in common Hugging Face cache paths are removed
5. Remove project-local `.venv` and Python `__pycache__` folders
6. Optionally remove desktop `Whisper Restart.lnk`

Notes:
- If the app is still running, close it from the tray or Task Manager before uninstalling for complete cleanup.
- Model cache cleanup is targeted to common Whisper model folders, not all Hugging Face assets.

## Usage

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Start/stop recording | `CTRL+ALT+D` |
| Restart manually (if the hook is lost) | Run `whisper-restart.bat` |

**Tray icon colors:**

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gray | Model loading (~4s) |
| Green | Ready |
| Red | Recording |

When the Tkinter UI is available, left-click or right-click the tray icon to open or close the dashboard with stats, history, and actions. The dashboard closes automatically when recording starts. If Tkinter is unavailable, the tray menu provides restart and quit actions and the overlay/dashboard are disabled.

### Tip: Mouse shortcut

With Razer Synapse (or similar software) you can map `CTRL+ALT+D` to a mouse button, e.g. Hypershift + scroll wheel click. Dictate without touching the keyboard.

### Tip: Autotranslate with large-v3

With the full Whisper `large-v3` model, setting `transcription.dictation_language` to a language different from the language you speak can make Whisper translate instead of transcribe. For example, if you speak German while `dictation_language` is set to `fr` or `en`, the output will be French or English. Mentioning the target language or a translation instruction in `transcription.initial_prompt` can reinforce this behavior. This is a side effect of how `model.transcribe()` uses the configured language, not a separate translation mode, so the result depends on the audio and prompt and is not guaranteed. This is not effective with `large-v3-turbo`.

## Spoken Punctuation

Say the word, the tool inserts the character. This can be enabled or disabled with `post_processing.apply_spoken_punctuation`; the default mapping uses German words and can be customized in `post_processing.spoken_punctuation` inside `whisper-config.json`.

| Spoken word | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Doppelpunkt | `: ` |
| Semikolon | `; ` |
| Ausrufezeichen | `!` |
| Fragezeichen | `?` |
| Gedankenstrich | ` - ` |
| Schrägstrich / Slash | `/` |
| Anführungszeichen | `"` |
| Punkt | `.` |

## Configuration

All user-editable settings live in `whisper-config.json`. It is standard JSON, so it does not support comments. When the dashboard persists a UI setting, it rewrites and reformats the entire file; keep a copy of any manual formatting or external notes.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ui.calm_mode` | Use the static microphone icon instead of the animated Electric Border while recording. Currently editable in the config file only. | `false` |
| `ui.rec_overlay` | Show the red recording bar and microphone overlay. It can also be toggled from the dashboard. | `true` |
| `hotkeys.dictation` | Start/stop recording hotkey | `ctrl+alt+d` |
| `audio.sample_rate` | Microphone sample rate for Whisper | `16000` |
| `audio.beep_volume` | Start, stop, and ready-chime volume, from silent `0.0` to max `1.0` | `0.1` |
| `audio.silence_timeout_seconds` | Stop recording after this many seconds of continuous silence; `0` disables automatic stopping | `20` |
| `model.size` | Whisper model | `large-v3-turbo` |
| `model.device` | Faster Whisper device | `cuda` |
| `model.compute_type` | Faster Whisper compute type | `int8_float16` |
| `transcription.dictation_language` | Language code passed to `model.transcribe()` | `de` |
| `transcription.beam_size` | Whisper beam search size | `3` |
| `transcription.vad_filter` | Enable faster-whisper VAD | `true` |
| `transcription.condition_on_previous_text` | Reuse previous text as context | `false` |
| `transcription.initial_prompt` | Domain-specific terms for better recognition | Comma-separated list |
| `transcription.no_speech_threshold` | Discard a returned segment when its Whisper `no_speech_prob` is greater than this value; `null` disables this post-transcription filter. This is separate from VAD. | `null` |
| `transcription.short_text_max_words` | Remove trailing period for <= N words | `3` |
| `transcription.debug_transcription` | Write `KEEP` and `SKIP` decisions for returned segments to `whisper-history.log` | `true` |
| `post_processing.apply_spoken_punctuation` | Enable spoken punctuation replacement | `true` |
| `post_processing.spoken_punctuation` | Ordered regex mapping from spoken terms to characters. The supplied mapping uses German terms and is applied case-insensitively. | See table above |
| `post_processing.word_corrections` | Ordered, case-insensitive regex replacements applied after spoken punctuation processing. | Regex mapping |
| `post_processing.hallucination_phrases` | Phrase list to discard when a full returned segment matches after case-folding and removing final punctuation. | Phrase list |

To switch the language, change `transcription.dictation_language` to your language code, for example `"en"` for English. Adapt `transcription.initial_prompt`, `post_processing.spoken_punctuation`, and `post_processing.hallucination_phrases` when they contain language-specific terms.

## Speed & Accuracy

The supplied configuration uses Whisper `large-v3-turbo` with CUDA `int8_float16` precision and `beam_size=3`, chosen for fast local dictation with good accuracy. For more precise transcriptions, or for better support for certain languages, you can select the full Whisper `large-v3` model in `model.size` and use a suitable compute type such as `float16`. `large-v3` is substantially heavier than `large-v3-turbo`: it requires more VRAM and a capable NVIDIA GPU, takes longer to load, and increases transcription time. Increase `transcription.beam_size` only after considering the additional latency and GPU memory use.

Benchmarks on RTX 4060:

| Scenario | Audio duration | Transcription time | Real-time factor |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Short dictation (1-3 words) | 2-4s | ~0.5s | 4-6x |
| Medium dictation (1-2 sentences) | 4-10s | ~1s | 5-10x |
| Long dictation (6 sentences) | ~55s | ~5s | 11x |
| Very long dictation (20 segments) | 73s | 7.7s | 9.5x |

Results depend on the microphone, language, background noise, selected model, and configuration.

## How It Works

1. **Hotkey** triggers audio recording via `sounddevice`
2. **Audio** is captured as a NumPy array at 16kHz (no WAV file intermediary)
3. **Whisper** transcribes with `faster-whisper` (CTranslate2 backend) on your GPU
4. **Post-processing** applies spoken punctuation replacement and hallucination filtering
5. **Output** is pasted into the active window via clipboard

The recording overlay uses pre-rendered animation frames (90 frames, 30fps) with 2D pixel displacement simulating SVG feDisplacementMap. A dual-ring system (inner plasma ring + outer orbit ring) with independent noise fields creates the electric border effect. All blur layers are pre-composited before the frame loop for minimal CPU usage during recording.

## Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Windows 10/11 + NVIDIA GPU | Fully supported | Developed and tested |
| Linux + NVIDIA GPU | Not compatible | Uses Win32 APIs (kernel32, user32, winsound) |
| macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon) | Not compatible | No CUDA support, no Win32 APIs |

The Whisper engine itself (faster-whisper) runs cross-platform, but the integration layer (global hotkey, clipboard, overlay, system tray, audio feedback) is built on Windows APIs.

**Contributions welcome!** If you'd like to port Whisper Type to Linux or macOS, PRs are appreciated. The main components that need platform-specific replacements are:
- Global hotkey listener (`keyboard` library -> e.g. `pynput`)
- Clipboard paste (`pyperclip` + `keyboard.send("ctrl+v")` -> `xdotool`/`pbpaste`)
- System tray icon (`pystray` works cross-platform, minor adjustments needed)
- Recording overlay (tkinter with Win32 click-through -> platform-specific window flags)
- Audio feedback (`winsound.PlaySound` generated WAV -> platform-specific sound API)
- GPU: Linux has CUDA support, macOS would need CoreML or CPU fallback

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| OS | Windows 10 | Windows 11 |
| GPU | NVIDIA with CUDA | RTX 3060+ |
| VRAM | 4 GB | 8 GB |
